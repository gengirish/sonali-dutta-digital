# Digital Profile AI — Cursor Skills

Skills for the **Digital Profile AI** business vertical — creating production-ready, AI-powered portfolio sites for professionals using Cursor and Claude.

Built following the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) pattern by Anthropic.

## How It Works

1. Client provides their resume, LinkedIn, or career details
2. Agent uses these skills to generate a complete portfolio in minutes
3. Deploy to Vercel with a custom domain
4. Client gets a live, interactive portfolio with an AI chat assistant

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [digital-profile-creator](digital-profile-creator/) | Main orchestrator — end-to-end profile generation workflow |
| [profile-customization](profile-customization/) | Theme, colors, typography, and section customization |
| [ai-chat-persona](ai-chat-persona/) | AI chat assistant persona and system prompt configuration |

## Quick Start

To create a new client profile, say:

> "Create a digital profile for [client name]. Here's their resume: [paste or attach]"

The agent will automatically:
1. Load the `digital-profile-creator` skill
2. Extract career data from the resume
3. Generate the `resume-data.ts` file
4. Apply an appropriate theme
5. Configure the AI chat assistant
6. Update SEO metadata
7. Build and deploy
